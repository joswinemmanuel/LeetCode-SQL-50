# LeetCode SQL 50 – SQL & Pandas Solutions  

This repository contains my solutions to the **LeetCode SQL 50** problem set, implemented using both **SQL** and **Pandas (Python)**.  

The goal is to strengthen database querying skills while also understanding how the same logic can be implemented using data manipulation libraries in Python.

## 📌 About SQL 50

**SQL 50** is a curated list of 50 SQL problems on LeetCode designed to cover:

- Basic SQL queries  
- Filtering and sorting  
- Aggregations  
- Joins  
- Subqueries  
- Window functions  
- Advanced SQL concepts used in real-world data scenarios  

This collection is ideal for:
- Technical interview preparation  
- Strengthening SQL fundamentals  
- Understanding relational data operations  
- Translating SQL logic into Pandas workflows  

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Covers

Each problem includes:

- ✅ SQL Solution  
- ✅ Equivalent Pandas Solution  
- ✅ Clean and readable code  
- ✅ Best practices and optimized approaches (where applicable)

This allows direct comparison between:
- SQL query-based data processing  
- Pandas DataFrame-based transformations

## 🔄 Why Both SQL and Pandas?

Modern data roles often require proficiency in:

- **SQL** → Querying databases  
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation in Python environments  

By solving the same problems in both:
- Query logic becomes clearer  
- Window functions ↔ `groupby`, `rank`, `transform` mapping becomes intuitive  
- Joins ↔ `merge()` understanding improves  
- Aggregations ↔ `groupby().agg()` patterns become stronger
